**Work in Progress**

Webapp to handle schedule with others

## Motivation
As my schedule gets busier, I would like to keep track of it easily. 
While there are existing apps with these functionalities already, why not create one and see how it goes?

## Security
As an infosec undergraduate, I will be focusing more on the security aspects of this webapp.
In particular, I will be practising the Secure Software Development Life Cycle:
1. Planning
2. Architecture & Design
3. Implementation
4. Testing / Bug Fixing
5. Maintenance
